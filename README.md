# addstract

I made this page as practice to cement techniques that I have picked up. Whilst working on my own projects I was beginning to get frustrated as my "designs" always seemed to be somewhat lacking. I thought it would therefore be fun to use a ready made design and recreate it as close as possible. To do this I found the excellent Addstract design by Daniel Mitev on Behance and got to work. Whilst the UI kit is fantastic, consideration had to be made for responsiveness, mobile menu and animations amongst other things. 

To make the site I implemented BEM methodology along side PostCSS. Along the way I came across a few challenges which were fun to find solutions for, one being buttons with a gradient border.

To get up and running quickly I used my boilerplate which can be found at https://github.com/willbuilt1/Gulp-Boilerplate 

This page was made using the free UI kit found at: https://www.behance.net/gallery/56133557/Addstract-Free-UI-kit. A big thanks to Daniel Mitev for the fantastic design.
