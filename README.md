# addstract

For this project I wanted to test what I have picked up so far to take ready made design and recreate it as close as possible to the original. To do this I found the excellent Addstract design by Daniel Mitev on Behance and got to work. Whilst the UI kit is fantastic, consideration had to be made for responsiveness, mobile menu and animations amongst other things. 

To make the site I implemented BEM methodology along side PostCSS. Along the way I came across a few challenges which were fun to find solutions for, one being buttons with a gradient border and also made my own Hamburger Menu Iconüçî!

To get up and running quickly I used my boilerplate which can be found at https://github.com/willbuilt1/Gulp-Boilerplate 

This page was made using the free UI kit found at: https://www.behance.net/gallery/56133557/Addstract-Free-UI-kit. A big thanks to Daniel Mitev for the fantastic design.
